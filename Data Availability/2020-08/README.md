**Abstract:**

  Recent advances in neural TTS have led to models that can produce
high-quality synthetic speech. However, these models typically require large
amounts of training data, which can make it costly to produce a new voice with
the desired quality. Although multi-speaker modeling can reduce the data
requirements necessary for a new voice, this approach is usually not viable for
many low-resource languages for which abundant multi-speaker data is not
available. In this paper, we therefore investigated to what extent multilingual
multi-speaker modeling can be an alternative to monolingual multi-speaker
modeling, and explored how data from foreign languages may best be combined
with low-resource language data. We found that multilingual modeling can
increase the naturalness of low-resource language speech, showed that
multilingual models can produce speech with a naturalness comparable to
monolingual multi-speaker models, and saw that the target language naturalness
was affected by the strategy used to add foreign language data.
