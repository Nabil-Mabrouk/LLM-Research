**Abstract:**

  Federated Learning aims to learn machine learning models from multiple
decentralized edge devices (e.g. mobiles) or servers without sacrificing local
data privacy. Recent Natural Language Processing techniques rely on deep
learning and large pre-trained language models. However, both big deep neural
and language models are trained with huge amounts of data which often lies on
the server side. Since text data is widely originated from end users, in this
work, we look into recent NLP models and techniques which use federated
learning as the learning framework. Our survey discusses major challenges in
federated natural language processing, including the algorithm challenges,
system challenges as well as the privacy issues. We also provide a critical
review of the existing Federated NLP evaluation methods and tools. Finally, we
highlight the current research gaps and future directions.
