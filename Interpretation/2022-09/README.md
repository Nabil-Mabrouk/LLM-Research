**Abstract:**

  A growing body of research in natural language processing (NLP) and natural
language understanding (NLU) is investigating human-like knowledge learned or
encoded in the word embeddings from large language models. This is a step
towards understanding what knowledge language models capture that resembles
human understanding of language and communication. Here, we investigated
whether and how the affect meaning of a word (i.e., valence, arousal,
dominance) is encoded in word embeddings pre-trained in large neural networks.
We used the human-labeled dataset as the ground truth and performed various
correlational and classification tests on four types of word embeddings. The
embeddings varied in being static or contextualized, and how much affect
specific information was prioritized during the pre-training and fine-tuning
phase. Our analyses show that word embedding from the vanilla BERT model did
not saliently encode the affect information of English words. Only when the
BERT model was fine-tuned on emotion-related tasks or contained extra
contextualized information from emotion-rich contexts could the corresponding
embedding encode more relevant affect information.
