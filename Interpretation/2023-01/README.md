## Large Language Models Are Implicitly Topic Models: Explaining and
  Finding Good Demonstrations for In-Context Learning

**Abstract:**

  In recent years, pre-trained large language models have demonstrated
remarkable efficiency in achieving an inference-time few-shot learning
capability known as in-context learning. However, existing literature has
highlighted the sensitivity of this capability to the selection of few-shot
demonstrations. The underlying mechanisms by which this capability arises from
regular language model pretraining objectives remain poorly understood. In this
study, we aim to examine the in-context learning phenomenon through a Bayesian
lens, viewing large language models as topic models that implicitly infer
task-related information from demonstrations. On this premise, we propose an
algorithm for selecting optimal demonstrations from a set of annotated data and
demonstrate a significant 12.5% improvement relative to the random selection
baseline, averaged over eight GPT2 and GPT3 models on eight different
real-world text classification datasets. Our empirical findings support our
hypothesis that large language models implicitly infer a latent concept
variable.
