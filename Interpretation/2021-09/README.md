## Similarity of Sentence Representations in Multilingual LMs: Resolving
  Conflicting Literature and Case Study of Baltic Languages

**Abstract:**

  Low-resource languages, such as Baltic languages, benefit from Large
Multilingual Models (LMs) that possess remarkable cross-lingual transfer
performance capabilities. This work is an interpretation and analysis study
into cross-lingual representations of Multilingual LMs. Previous works
hypothesized that these LMs internally project representations of different
languages into a shared cross-lingual space. However, the literature produced
contradictory results. In this paper, we revisit the prior work claiming that
"BERT is not an Interlingua" and show that different languages do converge to a
shared space in such language models with another choice of pooling strategy or
similarity index. Then, we perform cross-lingual representational analysis for
the two most popular multilingual LMs employing 378 pairwise language
comparisons. We discover that while most languages share joint cross-lingual
space, some do not. However, we observe that Baltic languages do belong to that
shared space. The code is available at https://github.com/TartuNLP/xsim.
