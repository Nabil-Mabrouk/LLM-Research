**Abstract:**

  Some consider large-scale language models that can generate long and coherent
pieces of text as dangerous, since they may be used in misinformation
campaigns. Here we formulate large-scale language model output detection as a
hypothesis testing problem to classify text as genuine or generated. We show
that error exponents for particular language models are bounded in terms of
their perplexity, a standard measure of language generation performance. Under
the assumption that human language is stationary and ergodic, the formulation
is extended from considering specific language models to considering maximum
likelihood language models, among the class of k-order Markov approximations;
error probabilities are characterized. Some discussion of incorporating
semantic side information is also given.
