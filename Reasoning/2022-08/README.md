## MDIA: A Benchmark for Multilingual Dialogue Generation in 46 Languages

**Abstract:**

  Owing to the lack of corpora for low-resource languages, current works on
dialogue generation have mainly focused on English. In this paper, we present
mDIA, the first large-scale multilingual benchmark for dialogue generation
across low- to high-resource languages. It covers real-life conversations in 46
languages across 19 language families. We present baseline results obtained by
fine-tuning the multilingual, non-dialogue-focused pre-trained model mT5 as
well as English-centric, dialogue-focused pre-trained chatbot DialoGPT. The
results show that mT5-based models perform better on sacreBLEU and BertScore
but worse on diversity. Even though promising results are found in few-shot and
zero-shot scenarios, there is a large gap between the generation quality in
English and other languages. We hope that the release of mDIA could encourage
more works on multilingual dialogue generation to promote language diversity.
