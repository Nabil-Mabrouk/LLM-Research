**Abstract:**

  State-of-the-art deep-learning-based approaches to Natural Language
Processing (NLP) are credited with various capabilities that involve reasoning
with natural language texts. In this paper we carry out a large-scale empirical
study investigating the detection of formally valid inferences in controlled
fragments of natural language for which the satisfiability problem becomes
increasingly complex. We find that, while transformer-based language models
perform surprisingly well in these scenarios, a deeper analysis re-veals that
they appear to overfit to superficial patterns in the data rather than
acquiring the logical principles governing the reasoning in these fragments.

## Validating Large Language Models with ReLM

**Abstract:**

  Although large language models (LLMs) have been touted for their ability to
generate natural-sounding text, there are growing concerns around possible
negative effects of LLMs such as data memorization, bias, and inappropriate
language. Unfortunately, the complexity and generation capacities of LLMs make
validating (and correcting) such concerns difficult. In this work, we introduce
ReLM, a system for validating and querying LLMs using standard regular
expressions. ReLM formalizes and enables a broad range of language model
evaluations, reducing complex evaluation rules to simple regular expression
queries. Our results exploring queries surrounding memorization, gender bias,
toxicity, and language understanding show that ReLM achieves up to 15x higher
system efficiency, 2.5x data efficiency, and increased statistical and
prompt-tuning coverage compared to state-of-the-art ad-hoc queries. ReLM offers
a competitive and general baseline for the increasingly important problem of
LLM validation.
