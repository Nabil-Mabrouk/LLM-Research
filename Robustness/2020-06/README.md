**Abstract:**

  In recent years, transformer models have achieved great success in natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. Most of the current state-of-the-art NLP
results are achieved by using monolingual transformer models, where the model
is pre-trained using a single language unlabelled text corpus. Then, the model
is fine-tuned to the specific downstream task. However, the cost of
pre-training a new transformer model is high for most languages. In this work,
we propose a cost-effective transfer learning method to adopt a strong source
language model, trained from a large monolingual corpus to a low-resource
language. Thus, using XLNet language model, we demonstrate competitive
performance with mBERT and a pre-trained target language model on the
cross-lingual sentiment (CLS) dataset and on a new sentiment analysis dataset
for low-resourced language Tigrinya. With only 10k examples of the given
Tigrinya sentiment analysis dataset, English XLNet has achieved 78.88% F1-Score
outperforming BERT and mBERT by 10% and 7%, respectively. More interestingly,
fine-tuning (English) XLNet model on the CLS dataset has promising results
compared to mBERT and even outperformed mBERT for one dataset of the Japanese
language.

  Generation

**Abstract:**

  Natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG)
are two fundamental and related tasks in building task-oriented dialogue
systems with opposite objectives: NLU tackles the transformation from natural
language to formal representations, whereas NLG does the reverse. A key to
success in either task is parallel training data which is expensive to obtain
at a large scale. In this work, we propose a generative model which couples NLU
and NLG through a shared latent variable. This approach allows us to explore
both spaces of natural language and formal representations, and facilitates
information sharing through the latent space to eventually benefit NLU and NLG.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two dialogue datasets with
both flat and tree-structured formal representations. We also show that the
model can be trained in a semi-supervised fashion by utilising unlabelled data
to boost its performance.
