**Abstract:**

  We address the design of a unified multilingual system for handwriting
recognition. Most of multi- lingual systems rests on specialized models that
are trained on a single language and one of them is selected at test time.
While some recognition systems are based on a unified optical model, dealing
with a unified language model remains a major issue, as traditional language
models are generally trained on corpora composed of large word lexicons per
language. Here, we bring a solution by con- sidering language models based on
sub-lexical units, called multigrams. Dealing with multigrams strongly reduces
the lexicon size and thus decreases the language model complexity. This makes
pos- sible the design of an end-to-end unified multilingual recognition system
where both a single optical model and a single language model are trained on
all the languages. We discuss the impact of the language unification on each
model and show that our system reaches state-of-the-art methods perfor- mance
with a strong reduction of the complexity.

## Large Margin Neural Language Model

**Abstract:**

  We propose a large margin criterion for training neural language models.
Conventionally, neural language models are trained by minimizing perplexity
(PPL) on grammatical sentences. However, we demonstrate that PPL may not be the
best metric to optimize in some tasks, and further propose a large margin
formulation. The proposed method aims to enlarge the margin between the "good"
and "bad" sentences in a task-specific sense. It is trained end-to-end and can
be widely applied to tasks that involve re-scoring of generated text. Compared
with minimum-PPL training, our method gains up to 1.1 WER reduction for speech
recognition and 1.0 BLEU increase for machine translation.
