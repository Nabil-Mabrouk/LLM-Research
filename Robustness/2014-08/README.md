**Abstract:**

  Delta modeling is a modular, yet flexible approach to capture spatial and
temporal variability by explicitly representing the differences between system
variants or versions. The conceptual idea of delta modeling is
language-independent. But, in order to apply delta modeling for a concrete
language, so far, a delta language had to be manually developed on top of the
base language leading to a large variety of heterogeneous language concepts. In
this paper, we present a process that allows deriving a delta language from the
grammar of a given base language. Our approach relies on an automatically
generated language extension that can be manually adapted to meet
domain-specific needs. We illustrate our approach using delta modeling on a
textual variant of statecharts.
