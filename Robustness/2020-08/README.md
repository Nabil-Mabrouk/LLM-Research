## Inducing Language-Agnostic Multilingual Representations

**Abstract:**

  Cross-lingual representations have the potential to make NLP techniques
available to the vast majority of languages in the world. However, they
currently require large pretraining corpora or access to typologically similar
languages. In this work, we address these obstacles by removing language
identity signals from multilingual embeddings. We examine three approaches for
this: (i) re-aligning the vector spaces of target languages (all together) to a
pivot source language; (ii) removing language-specific means and variances,
which yields better discriminativeness of embeddings as a by-product; and (iii)
increasing input similarity across languages by removing morphological
contractions and sentence reordering. We evaluate on XNLI and reference-free MT
across 19 typologically diverse languages. Our findings expose the limitations
of these approaches -- unlike vector normalization, vector space re-alignment
and text normalization do not achieve consistent gains across encoders and
languages. Due to the approaches' additive effects, their combination decreases
the cross-lingual transfer gap by 8.9 points (m-BERT) and 18.2 points (XLM-R)
on average across all tasks and languages, however. Our code and models are
publicly available.

## Language Models as Few-Shot Learner for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems

**Published Date:** 2020-08-14T08:23:21Z

**Link:** http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06239v2

**Abstract:**

  Task-oriented dialogue systems use four connected modules, namely, Natural
Language Understanding (NLU), a Dialogue State Tracking (DST), Dialogue Policy
(DP) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). A research challenge is to learn
each module with the least amount of samples (i.e., few-shots) given the high
cost related to the data collection. The most common and effective technique to
solve this problem is transfer learning, where large language models, either
pre-trained on text or task-specific data, are fine-tuned on the few samples.
These methods require fine-tuning steps and a set of parameters for each task.
Differently, language models, such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and GPT-3
(Brown et al., 2020), allow few-shot learning by priming the model with few
examples. In this paper, we evaluate the priming few-shot ability of language
models in the NLU, DST, DP and NLG tasks. Importantly, we highlight the current
limitations of this approach, and we discuss the possible implication for
future work.

## ETC-NLG: End-to-end Topic-Conditioned Natural Language Generation

**Published Date:** 2020-08-25T08:22:38Z

**Link:** http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10875v3

**Abstract:**

  Plug-and-play language models (PPLMs) enable topic-conditioned natural
language generation by pairing large pre-trained generators with attribute
models used to steer the predicted token distribution towards the selected
topic. Despite their computational efficiency, PPLMs require large amounts of
labeled texts to effectively balance generation fluency and proper
conditioning, making them unsuitable for low-resource settings. We present
ETC-NLG, an approach leveraging topic modeling annotations to enable
fully-unsupervised End-to-end Topic-Conditioned Natural Language Generation
over emergent topics in unlabeled document collections. We first test the
effectiveness of our approach in a low-resource setting for Italian, evaluating
the conditioning for both topic models and gold annotations. We then perform a
comparative evaluation of ETC-NLG for Italian and English using a parallel
corpus. Finally, we propose an automatic approach to estimate the effectiveness
of conditioning on the generated utterances.
