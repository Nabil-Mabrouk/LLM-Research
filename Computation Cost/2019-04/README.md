**Abstract:**

  When building machine learning models that operate on source code, several
decisions have to be made to model source-code vocabulary. These decisions can
have a large impact: some can lead to not being able to train models at all,
others significantly affect performance, particularly for Neural Language
Models. Yet, these decisions are not often fully described. This paper lists
important modeling choices for source code vocabulary, and explores their
impact on the resulting vocabulary on a large-scale corpus of 14,436 projects.
We show that a subset of decisions have decisive characteristics, allowing to
train accurate Neural Language Models quickly on a large corpus of 10,106
projects.
